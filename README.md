Panel Light Music Visualizer (Palimuvi)

Uses the BASS and BASS WASAPI library ( http://www.un4seen.com/ )to capture loopback audio then poorly process the fft and display it on StepmaniaX stage using the SMX SDK.

This is pre alpha level code. I don't expect it should work on your system but it does work on mine.
